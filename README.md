### About this app

LinkedIn functionality on the Jobs results section. Left side are available jobs, on click the details will render on the right side accordingly.

**This app is not fully responsive, just some**, it was done in a few hours and just because I wanted to see if I could implement such functionality. If you want to use it feel free to make it fully responsive.

_It uses fake data, it isn't connected to an API_. In a real life application you would be making calls to your backend to dinamically get the data. All the data used here was just filler data made by myself in a separate file.
